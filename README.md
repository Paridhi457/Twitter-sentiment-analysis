# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with RoBERTa
This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data using the RoBERTa model. It classifies tweets into three categories: Negative, Neutral, and Positive. The sentiment analysis is based on the cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment model from Hugging Face.

Overview

Twitter sentiment analysis is a popular task in natural language processing (NLP) and data science. It involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone of a tweet, which can provide valuable insights for various applications, such as brand monitoring, market analysis, and public opinion tracking.
This project utilizes RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data. It employs the following steps:

Preprocessing: The tweet text is preprocessed to handle user mentions and URLs. User mentions are replaced with @user, and URLs are replaced with http. This step ensures that the model focuses on the content rather than specific user handles or URLs.

Model Loading: The RoBERTa model and tokenizer are loaded using the cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment pre-trained weights and configuration from Hugging Face's Transformers library.

Sentiment Analysis: The preprocessed tweet is tokenized and encoded using the tokenizer. The encoded tweet is then fed into the RoBERTa model, which produces sentiment scores for each class (Negative, Neutral, Positive). The scores are converted into probabilities using the softmax function, providing a normalized measure of sentiment for each category.

Output: The sentiment scores are printed, along with the corresponding labels (Negative, Neutral, Positive). This allows users to understand the sentiment of the analyzed tweet.

Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:
transformers: A Python library by Hugging Face that provides state-of-the-art NLP models and tools.
scipy: A scientific computing library for Python, used here for the softmax function.
